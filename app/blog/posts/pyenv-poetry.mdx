This is going to be a pretty quick read, and it will save your future self hours of headaches and frustration.

Let's say you have a brand-new Linux machine or you've decided to start fresh and manage your Python dependencies better. If you're tired of virtual environment chaos and dependency conflicts, this blog post is for you. Let's dive into it!

### 1. Install `pyenv`

Start by updating your system and installing the necessary dependencies for `pyenv`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

Then, install `pyenv` using the following script:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Once the script completes, it will display instructions to update your PATH so that the `pyenv` command is recognized. Follow those steps by editing your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.zshrc` if using Zsh) with a text editor like `vim` or `nano`, then activate the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, with `pyenv` installed, you can install and manage different Python versions. For example, to install Python 3.11:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Downloading Python-3.11.11.tar.xz...
-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.11/Python-3.11.11.tar.xz
Installing Python-3.11.11...
Installed Python-3.11.11 to /home/<username>/.pyenv/versions/3.11.11
```

To confirm the installed versions, use:

```bash
pyenv versions
```

Output:

```bash
* system (set by /home/<username>/.pyenv/version)
  3.11.11
  3.12.8
```

You can switch between Python versions globally or locally:

- **Global version:**
  ```bash
  pyenv global 3.12
  ```
  This sets Python 3.12 as the default for all environments.
- **Local version (per directory):**
  ```bash
  pyenv local 3.11
  ```
  This sets Python 3.11 as the default for the current project directory, regardless of the global version.

### 2. Install `poetry`

`poetry` is a powerful tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. Unlike pip's basic requirements.txt approach, poetry keeps your code and dependencies organized, provides an intuitive way to manage them, and ensures reproducible environments with its detailed lock file system.

To install `poetry`, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Like `pyenv`, you'll need to update your PATH as guided by the installer. Update your `~/.bashrc` file and activate the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

With `poetry` installed, you're ready to start managing your Python projects. `poetry` defaults to the active Python version set by `pyenv`. If your project requires a specific Python version, ensure you've activated it with `pyenv` before initializing the project with `poetry`.

### 3. Creating a New Project with `pyenv` and `poetry`: E2E Tutorial

This section will guide you through using `pyenv` and `poetry` to create a new Python project step by step.

#### Step 1: Set up the Python version

Use `pyenv` to install and set the desired Python version:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11
pyenv global 3.11
```

Confirm the Python version:

```bash
python --version
# Output: Python 3.11.x
```

#### Step 2: Initialize a new project with `poetry`

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and initialize it with `poetry`:

```bash
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
poetry init
```

The `poetry init` command will guide you through:

- Naming your project
- Adding a description
- Specifying the Python version constraint (default aligns with the active `pyenv` version)
- Adding dependencies (optional, you can skip this for now)

This process generates a `pyproject.toml` file, which is the configuration file for your project.

#### Step 3: Install dependencies

Activate the virtual environment managed by `poetry`:

```bash
poetry shell
```

Add dependencies as needed:

```bash
poetry add numpy pandas
```

`poetry` will resolve dependencies and update the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

#### Step 4: Verify the setup

Check installed dependencies:

```bash
poetry show
```

Run Python within the virtual environment:

```bash
python
>>> import numpy
>>> import pandas
>>> print("Setup complete!")
```

#### Step 5: Share your project

To share your project with others, they can clone your repository and install dependencies using:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd my_project
poetry install
```

This command will create the virtual environment and install all dependencies as specified in the `poetry.lock` file.

With dependencies installed using `poetry install`, one can run any Python script with:

```bash
poetry run python script.py
```

This ensures that the script runs with all the dependencies it needs as specified by the lock file!
